# πFocus
PiFocus is a project which was started in the Ponjavic lab at University of Leeds with the goal of having a cost-effective, robust and easy-to-implement focus stabilisation system on our optical microscopes. Long image acquisition experiments require a reliable focus stabilisation system to avoid any defocusing resulting from drift of components. The approach that we employ for this project relies upon developing microscopes that integrate not only the illumination and detection paths, but also the optical focus stabilisation path. By altering the intensity distribution of a back-reflected beam at the camera, this method reports defocusing value and direction when the axial position of the glass coverslip or imaging objective lens changes.
