# Ï€Focus
PiFocus is a project which was started in the Ponjavic lab at University of Leeds with the goal of having a cost-effective, robust and easy-to-implement focus stabilisation system on our optical microscopes. Long image acquisition experiments require a reliable focus stabilisation system to avoid any defocusing resulting from drift of components.
